Message-ID: <0cbdaa793cb96e6d1553d090215061c6.squirrel@correo.robles.es>


Good evening (here) Andrew,

I am thinking on releasing KLog 0.5.0n as fast as we can... but at late in
2009. :-)

In the code I am working with I have commented out the DXMap code... I
really think it is a GOOD idea but we should not add it until we have the
0.5.0 released with no new features.

Maybe we could release when we have closed all the pending bugs as they
are today and any other that appears these days.

Once we have the 0.5.0 working and released we can start coding new
features. Do you agree?

Some questions:

What do you think about the importTLF function? Do you think it is still
needed? TLF is not under active development so I'm afraid that there will
not be many hams missing a way to import from tlf to KLog.

However, check the AUTHORS file check if you want  your email, callsign or
whatever you want.

Hi Jaime,

Yes comment out the DXMap, I was meaning to get the rest of the code up and 
running but unfortunately got sidetracked! I'll work on it as time permits.

I don't really know much about TLF but I'd say if we used cabrillo then we'd 
probably be OK as that seems to be a format lots of hams use, so yes, go ahead 
and remove it. Theres no real point in supporting legacy stuff and if anyone 
wants it they can ask! We can even write a quick conversion program to do it 
if needed.

I redid the cabrillo import function and I added another file klog-contest-
cabrillo-formats.txt that has the formats of any contest files. I'm hoping 
that this will be an easy way to use add contests to klog and has the bonus 
that it can be updated on the fly. I must admit though that I haven't fully 
tested it. 

We will also have to figure out a way of installing it in the users .klog 
directory. Perhaps and installation script. Can Cmake handle this sort of 
stuff?

I have had a quick look at the bugs and I think I have fixed the search stuff. 
I'm not sure though! Maybe you could have a quick look and check that it is 
working or there is something else wrong with it that I didn't see.

Are there any specific bugs you would like me to work on?

Andrew

Good morning Andrew,

I have just updated new code that tries to fix the last pending bug.

In my opinion what we should try is to:


1.- Remove ALL the code regarding the DXMap.
2.- Extract the po information and email to the translators asking for
translation. (already done)
3.- Test the code without adding ANY new feature.
4.- Fix any important last-minute bug that may appear.

What do you thing?
Maybe next week we can release 0.5.0.

Hi Jaime,

Sorry about the confusion there. I checked all the code and couldn't find 
anywhere dxspot was used but I couldn't find any - my mistake! All was 
compiling well for me too. Thats weird!

Yes I'll remove the dxmap stuff. I will wrap what's there in #ifdef and #endif 
tags for conditional compilation. At least then I can get back to where I was 
before, if thats OK with you.

I will give it a through test too and let you know of any bugs.

Andrew

Jaime,

A couple of things:

1. Is it worth making QLinedit's that are read only a different background  
colour so as users know they can't enter data into them? i.e. the ones on the 
search tab.

2. The import TLF is still in the menu.

3. Frequency cannot be updated manually. Probably got something to do with 
hamlib. Perhaps not a bug but feature request?

I have been thinking about how we go about installing files that Klog needs 
(ie klog-contest-cabrillo-formats.txt). The options I have found so far are:

1. Use KConfig class - this would mean that we could copy or access these 
files in the $KDEHOME directory. It would be fairly easy to use but if we want 
to use Klog on Windows or possibly other X11 window managers then this method 
probably wouldn't work.

2. Create a CMake install line that creates and installs the files in the 
users home directory when the run make install. This would be easy and would 
work on both Windows and Linux but if another user runs Klog then the 
directory wouldn't be there for that user.

3. Get Klog to create a dummy file when it creates the first .klog directory 
and then give the users the opportunity to download the file from somewhere. 
This would be fairly easy but we would have to add another setup option to add 
download sites.

4. Hard code in the INSTALL_DIR. This can be done using CMake. Create a file 
that holds Klogs global defines i.e. define.h :

#define INSTALL_DIR "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}"
#define CABRILLO_FILE "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/etc/klog-contest-cabrillo-
formats.txt"

then as part of the build add the following line to the CMakeLists.txt:

configure_file(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/definitions.h 
${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/definitions.h1)

This will replace the INSTALL_DIR define with the installation path as 
configured by -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=

We could then refer to file paths from within the code using this define i.e 
QFile installFile (INSTALL_DIR + "/etc/klog-configurations.txt"). This way the 
installation directory would always be hard coded in and so we would always 
know where to reference a file.

What do you think? Do you have a preference? Option 4 is probably a little bit 
more work but it would mean that there is a better chance of Klog working on 
Windows.

After Wednesday this week I won't be around until after the New Year as I'm 
off on holiday for Xmas and New Years. I'll also won't have access to a 
computer so no email!  Please let me know if there is anything else you would 
like me do do before then.

Thanks

Andrew
