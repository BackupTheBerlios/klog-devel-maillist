<PRE>Hello Andrew,

&gt;<i> Since I didn't have a contest logging program for Linux I used Klog 0.4.6
</I>&gt;<i> the version I added the contest extra code to.
</I>I think we could think about the contesting features carefully... It may
worth it as I don't know any contest software for linux that is updated
and works ok.
Do you know N1MM? A windows software with a lot of good features.

&gt;<i> This worked fine for a little while until I shut down Klog and tried to
</I>&gt;<i> load
</I>&gt;<i> the contest log I had just saved. This didn't work for some weird reason.
</I>Strange... I am still using klog 0.4.6 for my &quot;stable&quot; hamradio operation.

&gt;<i> in. Would it be worth considering using a database to store the Klog data
</I>&gt;<i> in as opposed to the QSO class? It would mean some rewriting of the code
</I>When I started KLog I considered using a DB to save the QSOs.
The reason for discarding that option was to make KLog as much
&quot;independant&quot; of other software as possible and avoid all the
configurations problems for the users as possible.

Moreover, another &quot;feature&quot; I am thinking for next releases of KLog (it is
still in the thinking-phase) of adding MS Windows support to KLog. That
way we could get many new users among the ham radio community.
KLog would:
 1.- be available to more users.
 2.- be a way to show&amp;promote free software and KDE to MS Windows.

&gt;<i> would take away the hassle of looking after what could become a big in
</I>&gt;<i> memory QList of QSO's.
</I>Today I am working flawlessly or at least without noticing load with a log
with more than 10.000QSO.
I have done testings with BIG logs (100K) and it works ok and I don't
think people works with logs so bigs! X'DDD



&gt;<i>It would also mean that all QSO's are automatically saved
</I>&gt;<i> when they are created - this would making the saving and loading not
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>Here you are right and I have to agree.
However that is the reason of creating a temp file with the log diff. I
suppose you have seen that now, KLogs creates a temp file with the QSOs
added between saves so no QSOs are lost in case of an unexpected
exit/crash.

Maybe we should rework this way of autosaving if you think it is not
working well.


Anyway, did you noticed any problem with berlios.de connection this
weekend? I tried to connect to update the SVN and I was not able to do it.
I also tried to connect to developer.berlios.de without success...
