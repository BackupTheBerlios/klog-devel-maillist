</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jaime,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the weekend I had some fun in the Oceania DX contest and heres what
</I>&gt;<i> happened!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since I didn't have a contest logging program for Linux I used Klog 0.4.6 -
</I>&gt;<i> the version I added the contest extra code to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This worked fine for a little while until I shut down Klog and tried to
</I>&gt;<i> load the contest log I had just saved. This didn't work for some weird
</I>&gt;<i> reason. So I thought &quot;easy I'll just edit the code and recompile&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately having upgraded to KUbuntu 9.04 which uses KDE4 the QT3
</I>&gt;<i> libraries weren't there - no problem I just installed them . But I still
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't get klog-0.4.6 to compile - something to do with looking for KDE
</I>&gt;<i> libraries  - probably version 3.x ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to cut a long story short I quickly had to find another contest logging
</I>&gt;<i> program for Linux. I then stumbled across one called QLE
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://home.kpn.nl/w.knol18/qle/qle.html">http://home.kpn.nl/w.knol18/qle/qle.html</A> - This was written by WIlbert
</I>&gt;<i> Knol who used to belong to our local radio club before he shifted back to
</I>&gt;<i> The Netherlands). After some fairly quick, although that easy,
</I>&gt;<i> configuration I was up and running again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mention this because QLE uses a SQLlite database back end to save it's
</I>&gt;<i> data in. Would it be worth considering using a database to store the Klog
</I>&gt;<i> data in as opposed to the QSO class? It would mean some rewriting of the
</I>&gt;<i> code but it would take away the hassle of looking after what could become a
</I>&gt;<i> big in memory QList of QSO's. It would also mean that all QSO's are
</I>&gt;<i> automatically saved when they are created - this would making the saving
</I>&gt;<i> and loading not needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Hi Jaime,

&gt;<i> Hello Andrew,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since I didn't have a contest logging program for Linux I used Klog 0.4.6
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the version I added the contest extra code to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we could think about the contesting features carefully... It may
</I>&gt;<i> worth it as I don't know any contest software for linux that is updated
</I>&gt;<i> and works ok.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know N1MM? A windows software with a lot of good features.
</I>I have used a couple of other contesting software programs on windows and they 
are very good but unfortunately (or fortunately) my main PC in a Linux one!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This worked fine for a little while until I shut down Klog and tried to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; load
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the contest log I had just saved. This didn't work for some weird reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Strange... I am still using klog 0.4.6 for my &quot;stable&quot; hamradio operation.
</I>Yes it was to do with my upgrading to KDE4 and having QT3 stuff unavailable. 
My klog executable was compiled on my previous version of Kubuntu.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in. Would it be worth considering using a database to store the Klog data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in as opposed to the QSO class? It would mean some rewriting of the code
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I started KLog I considered using a DB to save the QSOs.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for discarding that option was to make KLog as much
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;independant&quot; of other software as possible and avoid all the
</I>&gt;<i> configurations problems for the users as possible.
</I>Yes this is true but I was perhaps thinking of a DB linu sqllite ot Berkley DB 
with is really just a set of libraries available on most Linux boxes. Or this 
could be statically linked to the executable.

I would have still imagined that the database stuff would not be configured or 
seen by the users.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, another &quot;feature&quot; I am thinking for next releases of KLog (it is
</I>&gt;<i> still in the thinking-phase) of adding MS Windows support to KLog. That
</I>&gt;<i> way we could get many new users among the ham radio community.
</I>&gt;<i> KLog would:
</I>&gt;<i>  1.- be available to more users.
</I>&gt;<i>  2.- be a way to show&amp;promote free software and KDE to MS Windows.
</I>Yes this fairly easy with a straight QT project, I have done it a few times. 
In fact all that has to be done to run is for it to be compiled on a windows 
box and a small DLL included with the exe file.

The problem with KLog is that it includes some KDE and possibly some hamlib 
stuff that will not compile on windows.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would take away the hassle of looking after what could become a big in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory QList of QSO's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today I am working flawlessly or at least without noticing load with a log
</I>&gt;<i> with more than 10.000QSO.
</I>&gt;<i> I have done testings with BIG logs (100K) and it works ok and I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think people works with logs so bigs! X'DDD
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It would also mean that all QSO's are automatically saved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when they are created - this would making the saving and loading not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here you are right and I have to agree.
</I>&gt;<i> However that is the reason of creating a temp file with the log diff. I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose you have seen that now, KLogs creates a temp file with the QSOs
</I>&gt;<i> added between saves so no QSOs are lost in case of an unexpected
</I>&gt;<i> exit/crash.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we should rework this way of autosaving if you think it is not
</I>&gt;<i> working well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I see that you are using a QTreeWdiget as the main display widget, can I ask 
why you chose that over a QTableWidget which has a few more functions that 
would make some stuff a little bit easier?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, did you noticed any problem with berlios.de connection this
</I>&gt;<i> weekend? I tried to connect to update the SVN and I was not able to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> I also tried to connect to developer.berlios.de without success...
</I>Yes I did, I thought my account was broken!
