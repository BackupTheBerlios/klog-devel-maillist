Subject: [Klog-devel] Changes from the SVN via email
Message-ID: <ebff80164f95e3555048061a5ce6899c.squirrel@correo.robles.es>

Hello,

I have done some small updates to KLog's code.

The reason for this email is to ask if you think it is a good idea that an
email is sent after the commits to the SVN of KLog.

It think it is as it would help us to be informed about changes.

What do you think? Should I add this list address to the recipients?

Good morning (here).

The following is the result of the email notification of commits to the
SVN of KLog.

That is what I was speaking about.

As these emails may be "long" if we include several changes in a commit,
maybe it should not be sent to this list to avoid "noise".
I have created the "klog-svn"[1] mailing list and I will configure the SVN
server to mail commits to that list.

Subscribe if you want to follow the commits via email.



[1] The list has been just requested and it is still not created. It will
be created during the following 24-72h.

Good morning (here).

Just a quick comment regarding the logs...

I still have not tested this R35 update but I don't agree to remove the
"if" statements as it will (as you already said) increase the logfile with
no useful information.

Reading the logfile will be a longer process as it will have to read ALL
the tags.
ADIF files are sometime edited by the user with a text editor... we should
keep them easy to read/understand.

The specification[1] does not forbid what you are proposing but I think it
would not be a best practice.
If you think that we should improve the writting speed... IMHO we should
think how to optimize the function but keeping the log short and concise,
with all the needed data but simple and "good looking" :-)

Regarding the TODO... maybe we should manage this in the TODO file, or
maybe using a bug tracker... I think Berlios offers one.

Hello,
I have just tested the new code and I don't agree with this modification,
I am sorry.

In increases the logfile 5 times:
Before running KLog: 2606656 sep 22 19:02 klog.adi
After running Klog: 12647223 sep 30 17:18 klog.adi

So reading the log is much slower than before. It also generates several
errors in the log (creates the AF-0 IOTA for every record, sets wrong
powers and frecuencies. I suggest to go back with this and restablish the
log writting as it was before.

I will try to upload new code this afternoon.

Hi Jaime,

Yes I thought that might be the case with the logfile writing, we can just 
uncomment out the orginal code and take out the my changes. Maybe we could 
look at one of the following for saving quicker :

1. Append the log with changes that have been made since the last save.
2. Create a "save log" when a qso is added to that all that needs to be done 
is just a quick file write without all the logic surrounding it.

I'll keep thinking about it!

Andrew
