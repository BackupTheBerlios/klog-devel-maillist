<PRE>Hi Jaime,

Yes I was thinking about the cluster options. I think probably one of the 
easist is to use a QListWidget. This has an insertItem() funtion:

void insertItem ( int row, QListWidgetItem * item )
void insertItem ( int row, const QString &amp; label )
void insertItems ( int row, const QStringList &amp; labels )

With this we can always insert data at the top of the list by using:

QListWidgetItem *DXItem = new QListWidgetItem;
DXItem-&gt;setText(dxData);
dxclusterListWidget-&gt;insertItem(0,  DXItem);

The 0 being the top of the listwidget. I have done this before and it works 
well. 

I have also noticed that there is an error in here somewhere that crashes the 
program. It is a very weird one and it only appears sometimes. Its got 
something to do with QString I think the messages are similar to this:

ASSERT: &quot;i &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; i &lt; size()&quot; in file /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qstring.h

I not sure why this error happens but I have done a little bit of 
investigation and I think it has something to do identfying where the 
callsigns come from, possibly the world class.

Should we change the QTreeWidget to a QListWidget and use the insertItem(row, 
item) function?

Andrew

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When I started KLog I considered using a DB to save the QSOs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The reason for discarding that option was to make KLog as much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;independant&quot; of other software as possible and avoid all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; configurations problems for the users as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes this is true but I was perhaps thinking of a DB linu sqllite ot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Berkley DB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with is really just a set of libraries available on most Linux boxes. Or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this could be statically linked to the executable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok.
</I>&gt;<i> I did not know sqllite nor Berkley DB... I was that you were proposing
</I>&gt;<i> something like mysql or postgresql... ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> Let me read a bit about that and check for implications that this may
</I>&gt;<i> have. Today KLog works ok without sqllite... and I wouldn't like to limit
</I>&gt;<i> the portability to MS-Windows :-| as I told you I am planning to reach
</I>&gt;<i> Windows users too in a near future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have done a very quick check for sqllite and it seems that it is also
</I>&gt;<i> supported in windows systems so that would not be a great problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this would be a big change. Maybe we can add it to the future
</I>&gt;<i> feature list and plan it in a future release... at least as a test. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  2.- be a way to show&amp;promote free software and KDE to MS Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes this fairly easy with a straight QT project, I have done it a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; times.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In fact all that has to be done to run is for it to be compiled on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; windows box and a small DLL included with the exe file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great.
</I>&gt;<i> I have no experience on that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem with KLog is that it includes some KDE and possibly some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hamlib stuff that will not compile on windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are right again.
</I>&gt;<i> I did some reading some months ago... and it seems that for a Windows
</I>&gt;<i> port, we should use some compiler directives or something like that to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid trying to add hamlib support in the windows compilation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still don't know how to add hamlib-like features to a windows code...
</I>&gt;<i> but today I don't care. Maybe we can add a windows coder to do that part
</I>&gt;<i> when KLog is available for win systems ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see that you are using a QTreeWdiget as the main display widget, can I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ask
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why you chose that over a QTableWidget which has a few more functions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that would make some stuff a little bit easier?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea O:-)
</I>&gt;<i> I was reading and checking the classes docs and I saw the QTreeWidget
</I>&gt;<i> class... it was the most similar class to the QListView class that I was
</I>&gt;<i> using in Qt3 so I directly migrated to QTreeWidget.
</I>&gt;<i> I think that QTreeWidget may be very fast if we create and work with QList
</I>&gt;<i> class and then we call the QTreeWidget just for showing the data but it is
</I>&gt;<i> again another optimization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe using a QTableWidget is also a good idea as we could (I am just
</I>&gt;<i> guessing) allow the users to (quickly)edit the data directly through the
</I>&gt;<i> QTableWidget...
</I>&gt;<i> Again: we should add this to the TODO list and plan it to future releases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today I had no time for coding.. :-(
</I>&gt;<i> How do you think can we solve the fact that data comming from the
</I>&gt;<i> dxcluster is hidden as soon as new data arrives from the network?
</I>&gt;<i> It is not very confortable and it is a downgrade from previous (qt3) klog
</I>&gt;<i> release :-\
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am thinking of finding the way to insert instead of add the DXSpots and
</I>&gt;<i> then setting the &quot;focus&quot; to the first element on the list, the top-one but
</I>&gt;<i> I still haven't found how to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any other idea?
</I>
